NEW RULE ADDITIONS

VIEW RULES BELOW, THESE HAVE BEEN ADDED TO SAFEGUARD FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY.

19. Abuse of Position / Influence

Those in staff or leadership roles may not use their rank to manipulate, intimidate, or retaliate against other community members.
This includes:

Using your role to silence others or steer conversations unfairly.

Threatening to remove roles, perks, or access due to personal issues.

Coordinating group exclusion, harassment, or mockery.

20. Passive-Aggressive Behavior

Messages meant to mock, embarrass, or provoke others without directly breaking rules are still punishable.
Examples:

Sarcastic responses aimed at escalating drama.

Saying things like “ignore them” or “we don’t talk to them” in public chat.

Creating a hostile vibe through indirect jabs or coded messages.

Intent matters more than specific words. If your actions consistently stir tension, staff may step in.

21. No Grouping to Isolate Others (Cliquing)

Creating cliques that exclude or target others is not allowed.
This includes:

Only helping or interacting with a specific friend group while ignoring others.

Making inside jokes that intentionally exclude or mock other players.

Turning staff decisions into “us vs. them” disputes.

We want an open, welcoming community—not one ruled by favoritism or division.

22. Public Role/Rank Complaints Prohibited

Questions or complaints about staff roles, assignments, or promotions must go through proper channels.
Do not:

Publicly ask about someone’s promotion or demotion.

Complain about favoritism or rank changes in chat.

Joke about role assignments to stir up reactions.

Use the Internal Affairs or Staff Feedback form if needed. Keep the drama out of public areas.

23. Staff Conduct Applies 24/7

Staff are expected to uphold community standards at all times—even when “off duty.”
This means:

No trash-talking members or other staff in side chats.

No stirring drama in casual channels, servers, or DMs.

Staff influence doesn’t turn off when the shift ends.

If you hold a leadership title, your actions reflect the community. You’ll be held to that standard.

24. Indirect Harassment / Dogpiling

Encouraging others to isolate, mock, or target a member—whether directly or through suggestion—is considered harassment.
This includes:

“Soft” callouts or vague posting meant to stir others against someone.

Sending friends to argue on your behalf.

Creating pressure in side conversations (e.g., “we’re all muting them”).

You are accountable for the impact of your words, even if you don’t say it outright.

25. Undermining Staff Decisions

Questioning or criticizing moderation outcomes in public chat is not allowed.
You may not:

Stir doubt or gossip about staff bans, removals, or investigations.

Say things like “they got banned for nothing” or “staff are soft.”

Spread one-sided or incomplete info that escalates drama.

Appeals and questions must go through formal tickets or staff reports.

26. Reputation Farming & Popularity Abuse

Do not exploit your status or popularity to manipulate decisions, staff outcomes, or community discussions.
This includes:

Posting in a way that pressures staff due to your follower count, donations, or role.

Starting “support threads” to reverse actions taken against you or friends.

Using group chats or discords to stir community outrage or protest decisions.

Your position does not place you above the rules. This applies to staff, contributors, and large creators.

27. Excessive Public Roleplay of Real Conflict

Turning real staff conflict into roleplay jokes or in-character events is not allowed.
Examples:

Making an “organization” or group named after drama.

Roleplaying “bans” or “takeovers” based on real community events.

Using RP as a loophole to mock staff decisions or bans.

Keep real issues out of roleplay. It blurs the line and increases tension.

28. Staff Cliques May Be Investigated

If staff behavior shows consistent favoritism, groupthink, or retaliation, we may open an internal review—even without a public report.
Signs include:

Only certain staff enforcing rules or backing each other in reports.

Disproportionate bans or warnings against certain players.

“Look the other way” patterns for friends.

We are committed to fairness, not just rule compliance.

29. Off-Duty Doesn’t Mean Off-Limits

Staff are expected to maintain professionalism in all community spaces, even when "off-duty" or using alt accounts.
You may not:

Stir drama, gossip, or argue in public while claiming to be "off shift."

Use a personal or alternate account to avoid accountability.

Act differently in other channels or servers connected to MI.

What you do in Metro spaces—official or related—still falls under these rules.

30. Weaponizing Mental Health or Personal Issues

You may not use sensitive topics like mental health, trauma, or real-life situations to manipulate decisions or gain special treatment.
This includes:

Using those topics in arguments to avoid consequences.

Guilt-tripping staff or players over moderation actions.

Pressuring others into silence or pity.

We support mental health—but not when it's used as a shield to avoid accountability.

31. Community Stirring via Third-Party Servers

Creating or using third-party discords or groups to discuss drama, organize harassment, or protest decisions is not allowed.
This includes:

Private group chats meant to stir tension or coordinate “callouts.”

Using unofficial servers to undermine MI leadership or staff.

Inviting others to offsite convos that continue public drama.

We’ll moderate third-party drama if it affects our platform.

32. Staff Interpersonal Drama Must Be Reported, Not Played Out

If you’re a staff member having repeated tension or disagreement with another staffer, it must be taken to management or IA—not to chat, team channels, or members.
Examples:

Posting vague messages about “certain people.”

Competing over roles or responsibilities in front of members.

Rallying support for your “side.”

You are held to a higher standard when handling conflict.

33. No Chain Retaliation or Loyalty Voting

Once a disciplinary action is taken—like a demotion, ban, or warning—you may not retaliate, especially by:

Quitting in mass.

Threatening to "take your team with you."

Refusing to cooperate in protest of a single punishment.

Each situation is handled individually. Chain loyalty pressure is unacceptable.

34. Roleplay Rank Does Not Equal Real Authority

Holding a high in-game rank (e.g., Chief, Commander) does not grant real-world authority over other players. All players must treat each other with respect, regardless of in-game hierarchy. Misusing in-game rank to intimidate, control, or belittle others is prohibited.

35. No Gatekeeping or Elitism

Disparaging players for their experience level, playstyle, or adherence to specific roleplay standards is not allowed. Comments like "You're not a real role-player" or "This isn't how it's done in serious milsim" are considered gatekeeping and will be moderated.

36. Respect for Out-of-Character (OOC) Boundaries

All players must respect others' OOC boundaries. Forcing players into uncomfortable scenarios, ignoring safe words, or pressuring them to participate in certain roleplays is strictly prohibited. Consent is paramount in all interactions.

37. No Off-Platform Harassment

Harassing, stalking, or bullying players outside of the game platform (e.g., on social media, forums) is strictly forbidden. This includes creating or sharing content that targets or mocks other community members.

38. Accountability for All Members

All community members, regardless of their role or status, are held to the same standards. Favoritism, nepotism, or shielding individuals from consequences due to their position is not tolerated.

39. Clear Separation Between In-Character (IC) and Out-of-Character (OOC) Interactions

Players must distinguish between IC and OOC actions. Using IC scenarios to justify OOC hostility or vice versa is unacceptable. Maintain professionalism and respect in all interactions.

40. Mandatory Training for Leadership Roles

Individuals seeking leadership positions (e.g., department heads, moderators) must undergo training to understand community guidelines, conflict resolution, and proper conduct. This ensures leaders are equipped to handle their responsibilities ethically.

41. Regular Community Feedback Sessions

The community will hold periodic feedback sessions to address concerns, gather suggestions, and ensure transparency. This promotes an inclusive environment where all voices are heard.

43. Reporting Mechanisms and Whistleblower Protection

Establish clear channels for reporting misconduct, with assurances that whistleblowers will be protected from retaliation. Encourage members to speak up about issues without fear.

44. No Interdepartmental Rivalries or Turf Wars

Departments (e.g., LAPD, LASD, SWAT, EMS) must work together and respect each other’s roles.
You may not:

Start or escalate conflict between departments in or out of RP.

Discredit or mock other departments publicly or in private chats.

Claim superiority or authority over another agency unless it’s part of a structured RP scene.

We are one unified community—not a competition.

45. In-Character Rank Does Not Equal Real Authority

Your RP rank (Chief, Captain, Commander, etc.) does not give you authority outside of structured roleplay.
You may not:

Use your in-character title to intimidate, override staff, or control others OOC.

Attempt to lead or discipline people in Discord or community channels based on RP rank.

Staff decisions override RP hierarchy.

46. Over-Enforcement and “Mini-Staffing” by RP Leaders Is Not Allowed

Department leaders may not act like staff or enforce rules outside of what’s written for their RP department.
You may not:

Issue OOC threats like demotions, removals, or bans.

Use chain of command to punish others for OOC behavior.

Enforce RP policies as if they are official community-wide rules.

Report issues to staff or Internal Affairs instead.

47. Do Not Weaponize Department Structure for Ego or Control

Leadership roles should be about helping others—not using power for personal pride.
You may not:

Create rules, hierarchies, or policies that make people feel excluded or disrespected.

Flex your rank or “remind” others of your power during disagreements.

Build cult-like loyalty groups based on favoritism or popularity contests.

We value healthy leadership—not control.

48. All Departments Must Follow Community Chain of Command

Every department falls under Metro Interactive’s official hierarchy.
If staff, senior management, or community admins give an instruction, you must comply—even if it conflicts with your department SOPs.

If there is confusion, submit a department clarification request.

49. Training and Evaluations Must Be Fair and Not Abusive

Department trainings must not humiliate, shame, or “haze” participants.
You may not:

Set impossible standards or intentionally fail others.

Use sarcastic, hostile, or demeaning feedback during evaluations.

Rank people based on favoritism, inside jokes, or clique behavior.

Trainings are about community improvement, not gatekeeping.

50. Roleplay Hierarchy Ends at OOC Respect

You must treat all players with equal respect—regardless of RP rank.
You may not:

Ignore, mock, or dismiss lower-ranked players just because of their RP role.

Tell someone they’re “just a cadet” or “not worth responding to.”

Use RP rank to deny help or support in official channels.

Your character may have power—but you as a player do not.

[4.1.2] Criminal Rules – Kidnapping (LA / PERRIS)
Rule

Description

Max Participants

A robbery or raid may include no more than 8 active participants at any given time. This limit includes players inside or outside the property. Hostages do not count toward this limit.

Active Participants

These players must remain within the bounds of the targeted property and are allowed to engage in combat.

Passive Participants

Players like informants can stay outside but may not engage in combat. They still count toward the 8-player cap.

Combined Count

Both active and passive participants count toward the 8-player maximum.

Keys to Property

You may not rob someone for keys to their vehicle or property. However, you can force them to unlock a vehicle or property at gunpoint.

[4.2] Criminal Rules – Criminal Raiding (LA)
Rule

Description

Raid Cooldown

You may only perform one raid/heist, hostage/kidnap situation, or both combined every 30 minutes—regardless of success. Survivors may bypass cooldown only to retrieve gear or free party members from law enforcement.

Government Employees

Government employees are not allowed to participate in criminal raids or heists.

No Double Hitting

You may not wait for cooldowns to expire or for crops (e.g., weed) to finish growing to raid again. Once the raid is done, you must leave.

Broken Locks

If your door was broken open by lockpick or forced entry, do not re-lock it until the situation has ended.

Who Can Defend

Only those already inside the base at the start of the raid may defend it. Players may not join the defense mid-raid.

Prop Placement

You may not place props during raids, heists, or gunfights. Law Enforcement is exempt if placing roadblocks or defensive barriers for public safety.

Staying Inside Property

Defenders must remain within the property unless fleeing. You may not leave the base and return to reengage.

Third-Person Cameras

You may not use 3rd person in vehicles to scout ahead, check defenses, or gain info unfairly.

No Spawn-Area Defense

You may not use spawn areas like the casino or hospital for defense or hostage setups.

Counter-Raids

May only happen at player-owned buildings. You may not counter-raid a government building or any building currently being raided by police. Law Enforcement is exempt from this rule.

[4.3] Criminal Rules – Organizations (LA)
Rule

Description

Organization Names

Crew names must be appropriate. Names referencing real-world hate groups, slurs, or sensitive topics (e.g., “Isis”, “Nazi”, etc.) are not allowed. This includes bypassing filters.

Killing Within Orgs

Being in the same organization does not give you valid reason to kill others. You still need proper roleplay cause.

Declaring War

You may not declare war over small issues (e.g., car accidents). Wars must be based on major conflicts like drugs, weapons, or turf disputes.

Roleplay During Wars

Even during org wars, all normal RP rules (RDM, FearRP, etc.) still apply. War is not an excuse to kill on sight.

Group Activity

You may only commit crimes (e.g., mugging, raiding, heists) with members of your active organization or party—not both at the same time.

Org vs. Party

If you’re in a party, it takes precedence over your organization. The two groups must be kept separate and may not assist each other during active RP.

Rule
