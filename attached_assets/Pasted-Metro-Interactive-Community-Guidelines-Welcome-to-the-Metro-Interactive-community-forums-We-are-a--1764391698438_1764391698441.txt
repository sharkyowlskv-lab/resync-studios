Metro Interactive Community Guidelines
Welcome to the Metro Interactive community forums! We are a unique space built on two core pillars: being a vibrant roleplay gaming hub and a Christian fellowship. To ensure our community remains a safe, welcoming, and constructive place for all members, we ask that you read and follow these official guidelines.

These guidelines are a summary of our core principles. Please be aware that your use of these forums and all our services is ultimately governed by our full Terms and Conditions, which you have already agreed to.

1. Our Foundation: Be Respectful
Our community is built on mutual respect and fellowship. We expect every member to treat others with kindness and courtesy, even when disagreements occur.

No Harassment or Hate Speech: Harassment, bullying, personal attacks, threats, hate speech, bigotry, and any form of discrimination against individuals or groups will not be tolerated. This is a zero-tolerance policy and a direct violation of our Terms of Service (Section 7).

Keep it Family-Friendly: Do not post content that is obscene, vulgar, graphic, or sexually explicit (NSFW). As a 13+ community with a foundation in Christian fellowship, we require a positive and appropriate atmosphere for all ages.

No Public Accusations: Do not use the forums to publicly accuse other players of misconduct. Use the official in-game reporting tools or the private report forms on our website.

2. Contribute to a Safe and Positive Environment
Help us keep the forums a productive and enjoyable place to be.

Protect Privacy: Do not share your own or anyone else's private information (e.g., real names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.). Doxxing is strictly forbidden and will result in a permanent ban.

Stay On Topic: Post your threads in the correct forum category. Do not derail threads with off-topic discussions, flame wars, or trolling.

No Spamming: Do not spam the forums. This includes repeatedly posting the same message, excessively "bumping" old threads, or creating posts for commercial advertising or self-promotion without permission.

No Illegal or Harmful Content: Do not post content that is illegal, promotes illegal activity, or discusses cheats, game exploits, or malicious software. This is a violation of our Terms of Service (Sections 3.3 and 7).

3. User Content and Responsibility
As outlined in our Terms of Service (Section 5), you are responsible for the content you create and post.

Respect Copyright: Do not post content that you do not own the rights to, such as pirated materials or copyrighted images and text.

Appropriate Profiles: Your username, avatar, signature, and profile content must adhere to these same guidelines. Inappropriate profiles will be reset by staff.

Impersonation: Do not impersonate any member of the Metro Interactive staff, another community member, or any real-world person.

4. Enforcement and Reporting
Our volunteer and administrative staff work to ensure these guidelines are followed.

Use the Report Button: If you see a post or a user violating these rules, please use the "Report" button to notify our moderation team privately. This is the fastest and most effective way to address issues. Do not attempt to moderate a thread yourself.

Consequences: Breaking these rules can lead to content removal, a formal warning, temporary suspension from the forums, or a permanent ban from all Metro Interactive services, as determined by our staff and governed by our Terms of Service (Section 2.4).

Moderators Have Final Say: The decisions of the moderation staff are final. Arguing with or publicly disrespecting staff members regarding a moderation action is not permitted. If you have an issue with a moderation action, please use the appropriate appeal process.


Thank you for being a part of our community and for helping us make Metro Interactive a great place for everyone. We're glad you're here!
