RS Logo.pngOFFICIAL PROJECT REIMAGINED ROLEPLAY RULES
These rules outline the standards and expectations for all players participating in Project Reimagined. This is a serious roleplay environment with a strong focus on realism, immersive storytelling, and consistent character portrayal. Project Reimagined operates under a higher roleplay standard than casual or semi-serious servers.

All rules are enforced using a common-sense approach—if an action is clearly disruptive, unrealistic, or breaks immersion, it will be treated as a violation even if not explicitly listed here. Ignorance of the rules is never an excuse.
